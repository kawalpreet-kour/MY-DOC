## Introduction

This document provides a guide to Python CI Bug Analysis for Attendance APIs, focusing on detecting code errors, bugs, security vulnerabilities, and ensuring reliable and maintainable functionality.

---

## What is Python CI Bug Analysis?

Python CI Bug Analysis is the process of detecting errors, defects, or vulnerabilities in Python code.  
It ensures code quality, correct functionality, and helps catch issues early in the development process.

## Why Perform CI Bug Analysis for Attendance Systems?

Attendance APIs handle critical data like employee or student records, so analyzing bugs ensures reliability and security.

| Reason                  | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Early Bug Detection      | Identify issues before production, reducing errors. |
| Accurate Attendance Data | Ensures correct calculations and reporting. |
| Security                 | Detect potential vulnerabilities in API logic and data handling. |
| Maintainability          | Keeps code clean, readable, and easier to update or scale. |
| Developer Feedback       | Provides quick feedback to developers for faster fixes. |
