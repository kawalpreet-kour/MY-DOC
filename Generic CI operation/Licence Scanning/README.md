## Introduction
This document provides a guide to license scanning in software build pipelines to track third-party dependencies and ensure legal compliance.

---

## What is License Scanning?
License scanning is the process of analyzing all third-party and open-source dependencies in a project to detect restricted or incompatible licenses and reduce legal risk.

---

## Why License Scanning?

| Reason              | Explanation |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Legal Compliance    | Avoid violations of open-source licenses. |
| Risk Management     | Identify risky dependencies before deployment. |
| Governance          | Maintain control over third-party libraries in projects. |
