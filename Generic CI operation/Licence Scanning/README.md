## Introduction
This document provides a guide to license scanning in software build pipelines to track third-party dependencies and ensure legal compliance.

---

## What is License Scanning?
License scanning is the process of analyzing all third-party and open-source dependencies in a project to detect restricted or incompatible licenses and reduce legal risk.

---

## Why License Scanning?

| Reason              | Explanation |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Legal Compliance    | Avoid violations of open-source licenses. |
| Risk Management     | Identify risky dependencies before deployment. |
| Governance          | Maintain control over third-party libraries in projects. |

## Best Practices

| Practice                          | Explanation                                      |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Run license scans on every build  | Ensure every build checks for license issues.  |
| Maintain an allowlist of licenses | Keep a list of approved licenses for compliance.|
| Configure alerts for restricted licenses | Notify teams when restricted licenses are detected. |
| Keep scanning tools and dependencies updated | Ensure tools and dependencies are up-to-date to catch latest issues. |

## Conclusion

Based on ease of use, CI integration, and free tier availability, we recommend Snyk for license scanning in software build pipelines. Implementing Snyk will help teams continuously monitor third-party dependencies, detect license issues early, and maintain compliance with minimal manual effort.

## FAQs

1. **How do I integrate license scanning into my CI pipeline?**  
   Use tools like Snyk or FOSSA in your build pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to automatically scan dependencies during builds.

2. **What happens if a restricted license is detected?**  
   The scanning tool can fail the build, generate an alert, or provide a report so the team can take corrective action before deployment.

3. **Can license scanning detect security vulnerabilities too?**  
   Some tools like Snyk and WhiteSource can scan both for license compliance and known security vulnerabilities in dependencies.
