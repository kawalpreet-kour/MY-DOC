## Introduction

This document provides a guide to dependency scanning in React projects to track third-party npm packages and identify known security vulnerabilities.

---

## What is Dependency Scanning?

Dependency scanning involves checking all project dependencies against a database of known security vulnerabilities. The scanner identifies outdated, vulnerable, or risky packages that could compromise the application.
 

---

## Why Dependency Scanning?

| Benefit            | Description                                               |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Early detection    | Identifies vulnerabilities before production deployment. |
| Compliance         | Ensures the project meets security and organizational standards. |
| Risk reduction     | Prevents attacks exploiting vulnerable dependencies.    |
| Maintainability    | Keeps dependencies up-to-date and safe.                 |
